react-d3-webpack-setup
======================

This is my version of [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate). It is structured a little more to my liking and also incorporates typescript and d3. As I work with React, I will be expanding this setup.

Many thanks to bebraw and his very helpful [book](http://survivejs.com) as well as his [repo](https://github.com/survivejs-demos/redux-demo) on the subject.
